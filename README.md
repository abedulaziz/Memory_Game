## How to Play :thinking: ?

Concept of the game is simple, you have to press on the buttons that pressed by the game in the correct order without any miss.

The game will start by clicking on a random button. If you guessed the appropriate button clicked, another random button will be clicked and you have to memorize the clicks from the very beginning.

## Game Rules: :dart:

Good Luck.
